# DictionaryAssistantMVC
>An ASP.NET-Core MVC port of the DictionaryAssistant project with a React frontend.

This project is an ASP.NET MVC application which incorporates [this project](https://github.com/m-flak/DictionaryAssistant) into a class library.

This class library is then used by the application to seed a PostgreSQL database with useful data from a wordlist.

Finally, the data is made accessible through RESTful endpoints, allowing easy integration into a React frontend.
